The Department of Emergency Services houses the Hopetopia Police Department and the Hopetopia Fire Department. The aim of our agency is to ensure the safety of Hopetopians and respond to emergency situations quickly and handle them effectively. The headquarters of the Department of Emergency Services - which houses the leadership and administration offices for the police and fire departments - is in the Town Hall complex in the center of the city. Each Ward houses two precincts that cover roughly half of each Ward (a total of 8 precinct stations). The Fire department operates 6 stations in each Ward for a total of 24 fire stations. The Police Department and Fire Department sites provide more information about recent events for both departments and their current operating budgets.
